Twitter API 1.1 is now used in all requests
To achieve Twitter API 1.1 compliance the underlying library has changed from Twitterizer (which is now discontinued) to TweetSharp

 o  keep scroll position is also disabled currently

 !! no more mixed Views (Twitter and non-Twitter items) :(
 !! no more send to Pocket, Instapaper and so on :(

1.4.1
Tweets are now fetched 100 in the past on startup (has been 30 before). This value can be changed in the preferences (but 100 is the maximum). Maybe the old default 30 is still saved for your installation so have a look at the preferences.
Note: Fething more items will of course increase the ressources Nymphicus is using
Tweet Marker is now also saved every time when the main window loses focus (if another window - even another Nymphicus one - is opened. This is for example also true if you click a link in a tweet)
Tweet Marker can now be turned off (it's activated by default
Some smaller fixes

1.4
Tweet Marker now supported for both receiving and storing current read state (syncs last read items with other clients like e. g. Tweetbot on the iPhone) - see http://tweetmarker.net/
Added new account type: QUOTE.fm (see http://quote.fm/)
 - the APi is in early development by them so for now only reading (no write access, no authentication)
 - get your own recommendations as well as the ones of people you follow (like timeline)
 - subscribe to categories
Full favorites supports: own type in Views, filterable and own fetch algorithm 
Tweets can now be unfaved

 - comment on an item you also commented on or liked
 - comment on an item you neither commented on or liked
 - new likes on an item you neither commented on or liked
 - new likes on an item you neither commented on or liked
So you can disable notifications in Snarl you don't want to receive in more detail
In Facebook all comments are now fetched upon status retrieval
As all accounts can now be streaming (see below) the Twitter API rate limits are less important and the update intervall is now 90 seconds (has been four minutes before)

Facebook item display (especially images and captions) massively improved
You can now add a link to a Facebook status which is interpreted by Facebook as link (thumnbail and description added)
Image thumbnails on mouse over are now bigger (most of the time) in tweets

When opening new tweet window the textbox is selected and cursor waits for you start typing (...again, lost this when added auto complete)
As the gerneral unshortening service unshort.me has been cancelled I reenabled my own unshortening implemenations. 
 Pro: much(!) faster, I know works :)
 Contra: less services included (for now - let me know which you miss most)
  Currently: t.co, bit.ly, is.gd, and tinyurl

Speed and performance optimizations
Snarl notifications on inital fetch now reliable not being displayed (no more screen flooding)

Compose window opens now at the same location as the main window
